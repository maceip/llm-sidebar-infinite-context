## 🚀 Features

- **Frontend Only:** This extension runs entirely in your browser. There is no middle-man server; your prompts are sent directly from your browser to the Google Gemini API.
- **Infinite Context:** Pin unlimited tabs as context. An adaptive budget manager automatically summarizes or compresses overflow content to fit Gemini's context window, prioritizing passages relevant to your latest prompt before falling back to metadata-only context.
- **Multimodal Support:**
  - **YouTube:** Summarize or answer questions about YouTube videos.
  - **Google Docs:** Extracts content directly from open Google Docs.
  - **Web Pages:** Extracts text content from standard web pages.
- **Current Tab Sharing:** Toggle "Share Current Tab" (Eye icon) to dynamically include the active tab's content in your context as you browse.
- **Model Selection:** Choose between various Gemini models:
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (Default)
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro
  - Gemini 3 Flash (Preview)
- **Privacy Focused:**
  - Your API Key is stored locally in your browser (`chrome.storage.sync`).
  - Chat history is stored locally (`chrome.storage.local`).
- **Markdown Support:** Responses are rendered with full Markdown support.

### Native companion foundation

This repository now includes a Rust-based native companion foundation under `native/overlay-companion/` plus a Puppeteer harness under `test-harness/native-companion/`.

The native companion is designed around a durable daemon + native-messaging bridge split so the long-lived process can tolerate Chrome MV3 service-worker restarts and reconnect cleanly using JSON-RPC `hello`, `ping`, and `status` messages.

The harness builds the extension, builds the Rust binary, registers native messaging manifests in an isolated browser home, launches Chrome headless with the unpacked extension, verifies a browser-run memory-layer scenario through the real extension storage/API surface, and verifies native companion connectivity through a real heartbeat/pong cycle.

Cross-platform note: the harness now resolves `npm.cmd` / `cargo.exe` correctly on Windows, but the fully automated native messaging registration path is currently validated end-to-end on Linux. Windows still needs registry-based native host registration before the full harness can be considered production-ready there.
